# First Website
My first website, created from scratch in Level 1 of the Hyperion Immersive Bootcamp.

## Purpose
The purpose of this website was to get to grips with some Front End technologies used in Web Development.  It also showcases some of my personal interests, and career milestones.

## Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery

As this is my first website that focuses on front-end, it is still a WIP.
